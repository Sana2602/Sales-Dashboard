# Sales-Dashboard
I used Power BI, a business intelligence tool, to create a dashboard that displays the sales performance of SN Co-orp, a company that provides various products and services. The dashboard shows the revenue, profit, cost, and customer satisfaction of the company across different regions, categories, and time periods. I used data from various sources, such as web server logs, social media content, and cloud applications, and cleaned and transformed the data using Power BI tools. I also used smart narrative summaries to highlight the key insights and trends from the data.

The purpose of this project was to use data analytics to help SN Co-orp make evidence-based decisions, understand customer behavior, and optimize their business processes. Data analytics is important because it allows us to find patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the data, and to test hypotheses and predictions. Data analytics also helps us to communicate the results and recommendations to the stakeholders using visualizations and narratives. By using data analytics, I was able to provide valuable information to SN Co-orp, such as which regions and categories are the most profitable, which products and services are the most popular, and how to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
